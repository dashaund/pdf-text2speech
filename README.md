# pdf-text2speech
A small script that converts PDF files to speech using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)

# Usage
text2speech.py <file.pdf>

Only takes one PDF file at a time. The program will save the speech MP3 file to the directory it gets executed at. gTTS needs Internet so you need to have a connection for it to work.

Depends on gTTS and pdftotext
